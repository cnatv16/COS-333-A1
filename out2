Title:  Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques

Description: This is a course about the practice of programming.
Programming is more than just writing code.  Programmers must also
assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test,
improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves &
others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility,
robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications.  Students
will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their
own code and in group projects.

Prerequisites: COS 217 and COS 226.

Title:  Topics in the Intellectual History of Modern and Contemporary Spain: Culture and Memory of the Spanish Civil War

Description: An examination of the narrative, poetry, film, songs,
photography and graphic art generated by Spaniards and foreigners about
the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in the seventy years since the war was
fought. This cultural production will be examined in the context of the
political and ideological reasons that explain the international
attraction the war generated. Among the works examined: poems by Neruda;
Picasso's Guernica (it was the first war in which aviation played a
significant role); documentaries (The Spanish Earth, Mourir a Madrid);
and photographs by Robert Capa (the Spanish Civil War consecrated the
nascent art of photojournalism).
