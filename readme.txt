A paragraph describing your contribution, and another paragraph describing your teammate's contribution:

    I contributed to this assignment through a few ways. The first day we worked on the assignment, 
    I spent time trying to get GitHub set up correctly through courselab, as well as reading through
    the documentation for argparse to get an understanding of the module used. On the second day, 
    we worked together to work through the different quirks of argsparse, as well as 
    how we would build our SQL string for the correct database calls. I also went to office hours for 
    our bugs, and I've continued to work with Camila through understanding our issues. Then I wrote the
    test code for testreg.py.

    The first day we worked on the assignment we spent majority, if not all, the time trying to set up our 
    github repo and filezilla etc. We worked that day for about an hour. The next day we started the prepared 
    statement. I read through the argsparse documentation to make sure we were using the correct attributes 
    and then put together the SQLite string for the sursor to execute. Then I made minor adjustments when the
    output didn't look like what the refrence solution was. I also read the textwrap documentation, and was 
    finally able to get an output that looked like the the refrence solution. The next day I think we kept 
    working on the same thing as the 2nd day. I worked qucikly on regdetails since we already knew how to use 
    argsparse from reg.py. Then the last day I wrote testregdetails.py and fixed extra little things until 
    our output looked like the refrence solution. 

Help from other sources:
    - office hours on Saturday
    - bob dondero through emailing the cos333 instructors 
    - textwrap, argseparse documentation, as well as stackoverflow for SQLite

An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment: 
    - about 8, 1 hour for 4 days, then like 4 for the last day

Your assessment of the assignment: 
    - although it was tedious at times we learned alot about how to use the database, as well as 
    some of the potential issues with using textwrap. We also noticed how awesome argsparse is, 
    definetly simplified this assignemnt so much. I think we both learned alot and would say we 
    enjoyed this 7/10 which is alot for hw ya know?


Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. 
In particular you must describe all known bugs.
    - There's an Exception that we raise and catch, but hard coded in regdetails.py. The output comes out
    to look like the soulation output but we arent sure if there was a better way to handle that exception
    We choose to do it that way becasue we covered raising exceptions in lecture.
